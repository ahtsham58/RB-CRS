The description of the content in this directory is as follows.

  1.	The file named ‘Compiled Results.xlsx’ contains our overall analysis and compiled results regarding the online study.

2.	The file named ‘Invalid Trials.xlsx’ contains all the cases where the participants failed attention. Note that each user has 10 dialogue situations in this particular file. 

3.	The file named ‘Discarded Cases.xlsx’ contains those cases which we considered inconsistent as reported in the manuscript. There are 4 cases, thereby, 36 (9x4) dialog situations in this file. 

4.	Then we have another file named ‘Valid Trials.xlsx’, which contains data of only valid cases. The valid cases fulfill the following criteria as reported in the manuscript. 

    a.	The attention check is passed

    b.	The inconsistent cases found after manual inspection are discarded

    In this file, each user has 9 dialogue situations since the situation that belongs to the attention check is deleted for results analysis.

5.	The file named ‘Demographics Details.xlsx’ contains the demographics details of participants. Please note that we reported only those participants' data who passed the attention check.

6.	The file named ‘Anova.xlsx’ contains the results for both the ANOVA test and Tukey’s HSD test.

7.	The file named ‘Online studies raw data.json’ contains raw data of our studies in the form of JSON.
